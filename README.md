Cargo Connect

Cargo Connect is a simple yet effective platform designed to bridge the gap between truckers and load providers. It focuses on facilitating efficient logistics by offering two main features:

1. Connecting Truckers to Load Providers

	•	Cargo Connect provides a straightforward interface for truckers to find available loads from providers.
	•	Load providers can list their shipment details, including destination, weight, and special requirements, making it easy for truckers to identify suitable jobs.

2. Support for Partial and En-Route Loads

	•	Partial Loads: Truckers can accept shipments that do not occupy their full truck capacity, allowing multiple smaller shipments to share the same route.
	•	En-Route Loads: Truckers can pick up additional loads along their planned route, optimizing their trips and reducing empty runs.

Key Benefits

	•	Cost Efficiency: Enables better utilization of truck capacity, reducing costs for both truckers and load providers.
	•	Sustainability: Encourages optimized routing and capacity sharing, lowering fuel consumption and emissions.
	•	Flexibility: Offers dynamic options for truckers to adapt to changing cargo needs during a trip.

This project aims to simplify logistics management by focusing on the core requirement of connecting supply and demand efficiently in the trucking industry.
